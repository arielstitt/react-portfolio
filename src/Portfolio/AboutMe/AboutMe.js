                            <p> Combined with years of experience dealing with customers face to face, managing employees, and delivering clear communication to my team, I want to be the fresh and focused addition to the developer community.</p>

                            <p> Letâ€™s get to work!</p>

                        <GreenHighlight>Communication</GreenHighlight>
                        <p>One of the most important quotes from George Bernard Shaw is "the single bigest problem in communication is the illusion that is has taken place".</p>
                        <p>That's why I like to use Slack, email, and daily stand-ups to make sure that I am on track with my peers and work expectations.</p>

                        <GreenHighlight>Collaboration</GreenHighlight>
                        <p>Being able to effectivaly work as a team can have it's challeges. That's why I find it important to be open and honest with my team mates.</p>
                        <p>Being open and honest and giving and receiving praise and constructive critisism are some of my strongest suits. </p>

                        <GreenHighlight>Organization</GreenHighlight>
                        <p>Without proper organization, a project can come to a stalemate, with the developer and computer staring each other down in an indefinite draw.</p>
                        <p>That's why I familiarized myself with productivity tools like Trello, Google Calendar, and Jira to stay on track.</p>

                        <GreenHighlight>Documentation</GreenHighlight>
                        <p>There is nothing like coming up on an old documentation that just says <span>SOLVED!!!</span> without anything else.</p>
                        <p>My experience of problem solving and filling out almost 500 troubleshooting tickets a week, 75% of which were previously worked on issues, I know the importance of thouroughly documenting all stages of a project.</p>
